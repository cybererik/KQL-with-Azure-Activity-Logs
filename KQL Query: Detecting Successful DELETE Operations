-----------------------------------------

Description:
This KQL query analyzes Azure Activity Logs to identify users who performed more than one successful DELETE operation within the last 2 hours. It helps detect potentially unauthorized or bulk deletion of resources in an Azure environment.

Line-by-line Explanation:

1. let resource_threshold = 1;
   - Sets a threshold for the number of delete actions to consider suspicious. Here, more than 1 delete.

2. let time_threshold_in_hours = 2h;
   - Defines the time window (last 2 hours) for the analysis.

3. AzureActivity
   - Refers to the Azure Activity log table containing management operations.

4. | where TimeGenerated > ago(time_threshold_in_hours)
   - Filters the log entries to only include those generated in the past 2 hours.

5. | where OperationNameValue endswith "DELETE" and ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
   - Narrows down to only successful delete operations.

6. | summarize number_of_records = count() by Caller, ActivityStatusValue, ResourceGroup
   - Aggregates the results, counting the number of successful deletes by each user (Caller), along with the status and resource group.

7. | where number_of_records > resource_threshold
   - Final filter to show only users who performed more than one delete operation.
